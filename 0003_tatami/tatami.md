# Tatami

Sometimes, for me at least, high school could also kinda suck!

For example, things had gotten p miserable after the entire 告白(love confession)-fiasco at the math-club-try-out.

Honestly, if it hadn't been for かるた(karuta), things would have been, like the worst, I suppose, especially since I, never mind her shooting me down like a texan-sharpshooter, still had a MAJOR crush on the 部長(club-president).

Anyway, so, not even to get over her, but just in order to get by, I would focus all of my time and energy on practice:
- arm-swings for taking cards as fast and with as much precision as possible
- breathing technique for improved multi-syllable-card-timing
- card placement strategies
- ...

Although it may sound weird, those were the sort of things I cared about above all else back then, and luckily that turned out to be remarkably wholesome, since it provided me with some escape / relief / distraction from them "The Sorrows of Young Werther" feels.

Basically one could say, that my recovery proceeded a pace, but then, alas, fully unbeknownst to anyone, that fateful evening had arrived, which would change my entire life in the most dramatic way imaginable.

Here is what transpired:

Since on the next day my school was hosting a somewhat largish かるた-event, our usual hangout simply would not do, so it had been decided to move the needed 畳(tatami) over to the gym.

It was quite a bit of work and so after we had managed to set everything up properly, everyone on the かるた-team, including yours truly, was totally 疲れた(exhausted), so naturally everybody went home to get some rest.

Everybody except me that is, because, in my heart of hearts, I knew that かるた was the only thing that could keep my thoughts from gravitating around her like planets around their sun, from surrendering to her surreal forces of attraction, from becoming pulled in ever closer and closer, from what seamed like the only possible and inescapable outcome, namely to crash and burn.

So there I was, all by myself, kneeling on 畳, solemnly arranging those cards that meant the world to me, taking refuge and comfort in the sheer otherworldly beauty of this poetry, that, although composed many hundreds of years ago, could still resonate so powerfully within my juvenile heart.

As luck would have it, all of my three favorite poems, my most trusted allies, they were all sitting there right in front of me, helping me get through these tough times of trials and tribulations.

I took a deep breath.

"Maybe I'll finally be able to catch a break; for once" I hoped.

I felt at peace and began to memorize the various card-positions.

"よし(OK), lets do this" I whispered to myself and pressed the start button.

"難波津に 咲くやこの花 冬ごもり いまを春べと 咲くやこの花"

Curious things really do happen you know. I was totally beat, but hearing those words was all it took for me to fully recover in each and every way.

お手つき(faults)？

ふざけないでよ(you must be joking)！

I was playing the game of my life! Playing my heart out! All alone.

And then my ears picked it up:

"しの"

BAAAM!!!

That 決まり字(beginning characters / sound that uniquely identify a card / poem) somehow triggered my entire body to instantly react in the most violent way possible; I swung so hard at that card,... like u would not believe,... send it flying all across the floor.

To recuperate the card, I hurriedly scrambled after it, and that is how I almost ended up literally running into... HER!

"部長？！"　I stuttered in dismay.

She: "こんばんは(good evening). Interesting mats u got there."

Me: "HUH?!"

She: "You see, I just came by, because I was told to lock up before leaving. Then I saw those curious 2x1 mats and that got me thinking about how many ways one could tile an MxN region using them."

Me: "...And, did you figure it out?"

She: "Sure did."

She beamed.

I was still feeling as flabbergasted as confused.

Me: "So what's the answer?"

She: "I could tell you, but I am afraid you wouldn't understand."

She: "No offence."

Me: "None taken."

She: "Actually, you know what, ever since u came to the club-room, I have kinda been meaning to talk to you, but you seamed rather stressed out about it, and so I figured it would perhaps be best to let things go for the sake of minimizing awkwardness."

Me: "Club-room?... Oh... right... but that's like ancient history to me,... already forgot all about it tbh, so... no worries."

She: "Look, since things didn't work out too well last time, I'll let u have one more shot at it, if u r still interested, that is."

Me: "Hit me!"

She: "How many ways can one tile a 2x9 region using such 2x1 mats？ Again, u have one minute; 頑張って."
 
Me: "マジか(seriously)？"

She: "59"

I closed my eyes, tried to focus on the problem at hand, but with her standing there right next to me, wearing that perfume and all, I realized that this was totally 無理(impossible).

Me: "狡い(not fair)。"

She: "43"

Me: "狡いよ(so not fair)！"

She: "42！"

Me: "結婚して下さい(please marry me)！"

She: ":-)"

She: "馬鹿(idiot)！本当に(seriously)！"

She: ":x: ですよ(so wrong)！"

She: "Also, why wouldn't you simply ask me out for coffee like a normal person?! 馬鹿！"

Me: "Coffee sounds great! ...じゃあデートです(it's a date)!"

She smiled.

Me too.

She: "Also, you are so not on the math-team!"

Me: "はい(understood)"

She: "馬鹿！"

Me: "はい(present)"

Would you have been able to make the team this time? Here is an example illustration for one possible 2x9 tiling.

Ganbatte!
