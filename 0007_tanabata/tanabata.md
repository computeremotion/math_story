# Tanabata

Now it may sound cruel, but, ngl, I don't really mind the tears of 織姫(Orihime) and 彦星(Hikoboshi) too much.

And here is as for the why:

Going out with the 部長 was just such an incredibly awesome experience, always!, so naturally I was really looking forward to our first 七夕(Tanabata - Star Festival) as a couple.

Unfortunately, it would rain cats and dogs that entire week; hence no festival.

Anyway, long story short, instead of going out on a デート with the 部長, I ended up doing かるた-practice-matches with my best mate フランツ(Franz); and although usually we were p much on a par in terms of playing ability, during our first match, at his cursed hands, I would suffer a devastating defeat.

フランツ: "Need some rest?"

Me: "平気(I'm fine)."

フランツ: "Dude, you just lost by 23 cards!"

Me: "So?"

フランツ: "So you suck!"

Me: "No, YOU suck!"

フランツ: "No, I just beat the crap outa ya, ergo, I rock, whereas you suck."

Me: "Jerk!"

フランツ: "Loser!"

Me: "That's it! Rematch! NOW!"

フランツ: "Bring it!"

Our second match turned out a super close and intense one, so that by the end of it, we were both drenched in sweat. I lost by two cards.

Me (panting): "Well played."

フランツ: "You too."

Me (still short of breath): "ああ、楽しかった(Ahh, this was fun)!"

フランツ: "うん(Agreed)."

Me: "自動販売機(vending machine)?"

フランツ: "Sounds good."

Me: "My treat."

フランツ: "Better still."

Drinks in hand we made ourselves comfortable on a nearby flight of stairs.

フランツ: "So, why the foul mood before?"

Me: "Yeah, sry, bout that. It's just that I was kinda looking forward to 七夕 this year." 

フランツ: "Hmm... なるほど(I see)... actually there is a German proverb that fits the situation p well..."

Me: "Isn't there always?..."

フランツ: "Ein Gesicht wie sieben Tage Regenwetter."

Me: "どうも(Thank you)."

フランツ: "いいえ(you're welcome)."

We laughed.

Me: "Seriously dude, this entire 七夕 not happening thing really is a shame you know... I mean, I had already contemplated my 短冊(Tanzaku) and stuff... so of course I'm gonna feel down somewhat... I mean... can u blame me?"

フランツ: "Sure can! Sure am!"

Me: "Dude, just have some mercy on me, will ya?"

フランツ: "Absolutely not!... I mean... look... idk,... isn't the entire story behind that festival essentially 'bout bros before hoes?"

Me: "Excuse me?!"

フランツ: "Well, think about it, both the princess and the shepherd-lad had, like everybody else, some stuff going on in their lives, but then, after hooking up, their frickin’ romance is all they care about; so naturally the gods would wanna punish them for such inconsiderate behavior!"

Me: :-/ (skeptical facial expression)

フランツ: "Listen bro,... just don't anger the gods by obsessing over your girlfriend too much,... coz nothing good will come of it... that's all I am saying..."

We exchanged looks for a sec; then,... I punched his shoulder.

Me: "Gotcha,... so, basically you're feeling neglected, aren't cha? :-)"

フランツ: "当たり前でしょう（Duh）!"

We laughed.

Me: "Okay, so 教えてくれ(plz tell me), what can a mere mortal do in order to appease the wrath of the Gods?"

フランツ: "Well for starters: LESS MATH-TALK!"

Me: "え？ Where did that come from?... What do you mean?"

フランツ: "I mean, ever since you landed that chick you keep spouting atrocious nonsense 'bout prime numbers and such! So obnoxious!"

Me: "Did you just say, nonsense?!"

フランツ: "I mean, so what if you can't square a circle,... so what if any natural number can be expressed as the sum of 4 squares?! So what?! So what?! So what?! WHO CARES?!"

Me: "'Ton' of folks actually!"

フランツ: "I don't think so. I believe that all of this rambling about the fascination of mathematics is really just about showing off smarts... 'bout superiority,... 'bout discrimination!"

Me: "Come on!"

フランツ: "Don't think so? Well then tell me this: What phrase was engraved at the door of Plato's Academy back in ancient Athens?"

Me: "さあ(no idea)..."

フランツ: "Let no one ignorant of geometry come under my roof."

Me: "Hmm... didn't know that... is that really so?"

フランツ: "Yes,... and to the Greeks geometry p much equates to all of math mind u..."

Me: "Now wait a second... are u seriously trying to argue that ppl are into math, mainly bec of the prestige / power etc. that's involved?"

フランツ: "Absolutely! Incidentally that is exactly why kids who excel at math tend to like it, while kids who struggle don't. It's not about the math per se, coz again, nobody really gives a damn about right-triangles and what have you, it is all about schoolmates / parents / teachers and so forth i.e. 'bout being labeled bright or a dense... about being praised or reproved... THAT KINDA STUFF IS WHAT MATTERS TO PEOPLE... not squares, not circles and not PI and whether or not that is an irrational number!"

Me: "Okay, okay, since ooobviously, you have it all figured out... what about me then... I was never any good at math... so how come I am, yes I'll admit it, semi-obsessed with it now?"

フランツ: "...well... coz you're dating the hottest math-geek on the planet... DUH!"

Me: "Oh gemme a break, will u?!... I mean... this is absurd... I mean... "

This was so outrageous; I was sorta lost for words.

フランツ: "...you mean what?"

Me: "Just give me a sec to organize my thoughts!"

フランツ: "...take your time..."

Me: "How about this:"

Me: "Just this morning I figured out what remainder one gets when dividing 2 raised to the 87th power by 13."

フランツ: "おめでとう(congratulations)."

Me: "No, seriously, isn't it just fascinating to ponder such abstract number related matters?"

フランツ: "Totally! Also, I have no idea how to figure that out... I suppose most ppl don't... so, WOW!... I guess that means u got much more brains than the average blue-collar-fella!... WOW!... good for you!... Also, what if you report this recent accomplishment of yours to the 部長?... she might even pad you on your marvelously ingenious head a bit... saying 'attaboy!' or something... so clearly this is all about the vast joy that's inherent in pure number theory... very convincing indeed!"

Me: "Jerk!"

フランツ: "Sucker!"

We laughed.

フランツ finished up the last of his drink and then got back up on his feet.

フランツ: "ともかく(in any case), score is still: Moi - dos; お前(you) - zilch."

Me: "True."

フランツ: "Best outa seven?"

Me: "You're on!"

Four matches later the score read 3 to 3. I was back in the game! But much more importantly I had been reminded of just how dear my only real 幼なじみ(childhood friend) still was to me; realized that there will always be this invisible bond of comradeship connecting the two of us, no matter what outrageous statements that weirdo would wanna argue next, for ultimately, just as with kinship, none of that mattered, coz he was ma bro and nothing could ever change that!

And so that is why, ever since that day and no matter how busy life would inevitably get, rain on 七夕, for me, has been and will always remain all about celebrating and cherishing this our peculiar friendship; which is why, I don't really mind finding, every so often, the star-crossed-lovers unable to meet up; crying a river.

Anyway, can you figure out that remainder problem?

Ganbatte!
